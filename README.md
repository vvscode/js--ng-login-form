Be sure that you have gulp installed `npm g -g gulp`

Gulp tasks:

- `$ gulp` to build an optimized version of your application in folder dist
- `$ gulp serve` to start BrowserSync server on your source files with live reload
- `$ gulp serve:dist` to start BrowserSync server on your optimized application without live reload
- `$ gulp dist` build project into dist directory
- `$ gulp protractor` run e2e tests ( be sure that you already run local server )
- `$ gulp protractor:src` run server and e2e tests

Or just `npm run start`
