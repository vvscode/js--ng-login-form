Be sure that you have gulp installed `npm g -g gulp`

Gulp tasks:

- `$ gulp` to build an optimized version of your application in folder dist
- `$ gulp serve` to start BrowserSync server on your source files with live reload
- `$ gulp serve:dist` to start BrowserSync server on your optimized application without live reload
- `$ gulp dist` build project into dist directory

Or just `npm run start`
